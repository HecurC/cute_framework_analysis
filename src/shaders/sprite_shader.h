    Overview:

        Shader program 'shd':
            Get shader desc: sprite_default_shd_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_sprite_default_vs_in_pos = 0
                    ATTR_sprite_default_vs_in_uv = 1
                    ATTR_sprite_default_vs_in_alpha = 2
                Uniform block 'vs_params':
                    C struct: sprite_default_vs_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_sprite_default_vs_params = 0
            Fragment shader: fs
                Uniform block 'fs_params':
                    C struct: sprite_default_fs_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_sprite_default_fs_params = 0
                Image 'u_image':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D

                    Bind slot: SLOT_sprite_default_u_image = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader shd = sg_make_shader(sprite_default_shd_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {

                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_sprite_default_u_image = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'vs_params':

        sprite_default_vs_params_t vs_params = {
            .u_mvp = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_sprite_default_vs_params, &SG_RANGE(vs_params));

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'fs_params':

        sprite_default_fs_params_t fs_params = {
            .u_texture_size = ...;
            .u_tint = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_sprite_default_fs_params, &SG_RANGE(fs_params));
