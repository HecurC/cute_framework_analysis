Returns an empty sprite.

```cpp
CF_Sprite cf_sprite_defaults()
```

## Remarks

Empty sprites can not be drawn. You probably don't want this function unless you know what you're doing, instead,
you may be looking for [cf_make_sprite](/sprite/cf_make_sprite.md) or [cf_make_easy_sprite](/sprite/cf_make_easy_sprite.md).
