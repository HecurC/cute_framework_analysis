# protocol

The Cute Protocol is a lower level implementation that CF's [Client](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/tree/master/docs/networking/client) and [Server](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/tree/master/docs/networking/server) abstractions are implemented with. Only one function is particularly useful to CF users: [generate_connect_token](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/docs/networking/protocol/generate_connect_token.md). If you're curious you can read about the lower level details here in the [Cute Protocol Standard](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/docs/networking/protocol/protocol.md).
